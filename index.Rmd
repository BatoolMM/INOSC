#### What is Open Science?
#####In a nutshell, Open Science describes an on-going movement in the way research is performed, researchers collaborate, knowledge is shared, and science is organised. It affects the whole research cycle and its stakeholders, enhances science by facilitating more transparency, openness, networking and collaboration. — OpenAIRE]

###### After the pandemic, 193 countries gathered in Paris for the 40th session of the UNESCO's General Conference and decided to embark on a new global normative instrument on Open Science. It's referred to as the "UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science".

###### This process is expected to lead to the adoption of the recommendation by UNESCO Member States in 2021.

###### Therefore, there is an increasing number of Open Science Communities in Europe

--

###### A vast network of Open Science Communities is in the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, UK and many other countries ...

--

###### BUT Open Science movement is not yet adopted in the Middle East

###### In 2021, We started an Open Science Community in Saudi Arabia

--

###### We are in the process of re-designing Open Science for Saudi Arabia to  potentially be adopted by the other countries in the Middle East

#### Our Vision statement 

.bg-white.b--purple.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
We want to create a space in Saudi Arabia where newcomers and seasoned peers can connect, inspire each other, and provide input on policies and infrastructures. Working together to make Open Science the norm. So, we are calling out to researchers and colleagues in Saudi Arabia.

## More Plans ...

###### -  We want to establish a digital presence (e.g. Website and social media accounts). We already have a community in Zenodo and GitHub organisation account.

###### - We want to start to build a local community for the carpentries in the Middle East (I'm designing a lesson about scRNA-seq in the carpentries) and with the R community.

## Plans for March 2021

###### - Encourage Saudi to get involved in the global useR conference 2021 (deadline for talks submission is the 10th of March).

###### - We planning for a mentorship programe in the summer.

###### - I'm delivering a workshop as a part of [Repro4Everyone](https://repro4everyone.org/) and helping with collaborative workshop runs by the turing way in [Software Sustainability Institute (SSI)](https://software.ac.uk/).
