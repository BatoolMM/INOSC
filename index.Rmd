###### In 2021, We started an Open Science Community in Saudi Arabia

###### We are in the process of re-designing Open Science for Saudi Arabia to  potentially be adopted by the other countries in the Middle East

## Plans for March 2021


###### -  We want to establish a digital presence (e.g. Website and social media accounts). We already have a community in Zenodo and GitHub organisation account.

###### - We want to start to build a local community for the carpentries in the Middle East (I'm designing a lesson about scRNA-seq in the carpentries).

## More Plans ...

###### - We want to encourage researchers in Saudi Arabia to get involved in the global useR conference 2021 (deadline for talks is the 10th of March).

###### - We planning to produce a newsletter, arrange for [ReproHack](https://reprohack.github.io/reprohack-hq/) and a mentorship programme in the summer. We are also in discussion with the legal team to register the community.

###### - I'm delivering a workshop as a part of [Repro4Everyone](https://repro4everyone.org/) and helping with collaborative workshop runs by the turing way in [Software Sustainability Institute (SSI)](https://software.ac.uk/).
