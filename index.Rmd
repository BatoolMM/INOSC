###### In 2021, We started an Open Science Community in Saudi Arabia

--

###### We are in the process of re-designing Open Science for Saudi Arabia to  potentially be adopted by the other countries in the Middle East

###### The Open Science Community in Saudi Arabia is supported by [Open Life Science Programme](https://openlifesci.org/)

###### Led by Batool Almarzouq, Anelda Van der Walt and Paula Moraga

###### Since Saudi Arabia is not part of mature research systems, we want to build practices for open science from the ground up. The aim is that scientific communities will incorporate these principles as they grow.

###### - Our communities’ needs differ from those that are part of mature research systems. So, rather than shifting and shaping established systems, scientists are endeavouring to design new ones.

###### - We disadvantaged by government policies that increase apparent productivity at the expense of quality.

###### - The goverment is pushing towards increase publication quantity to ‘catch up’ with other countries, but inadvertently encourage poor research practices. Scientists have resorted to publishing in predatory journals to boost publication count.

###### - We cannot waste resources on funding untrustworthy research. Policies should therefore be designed to improve transparency, relevance and scientific rigour, rather than just to increase output.

######  More than 80% of the world’s population live in areas where research is developing, suggesting massive untapped scientific potential. This diverse group of people would provide new ways of thinking about old problems. And global collaborations would increase each researcher’s access to resources and samples that might currently be off limits.

## Examples of our activities in Feb 2021

###### - A workshop in Women in Data Science (WiDS2021) in Saudi Arabia, under the title ["Collaborating on Open Data Science Projects"](https://batoolmm.github.io/Collaborating-on-Open-Data-Science-Projects/)

## Plans for March 2021


###### -  We want to establish a digital presence (e.g. Website and social media accounts). We already have a community in Zenodo and GitHub organisation account.

###### - We want to start to build a local community for the carpentries in the Middle East (I'm designing a lesson about scRNA-seq in the carpentries).

## More Plans ...


###### - We planning to produce a newsletter, arrange for [ReproHack](https://reprohack.github.io/reprohack-hq/) and a mentorship programme in the summer. We are also in discussion with the legal team to register the community.

###### - I'm delivering a workshop as a part of [Repro4Everyone](https://repro4everyone.org/) and helping with collaborative workshop runs by the turing way in [Software Sustainability Institute (SSI)](https://software.ac.uk/).
